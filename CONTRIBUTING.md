There's no so much to say about contributing here. I'd be happy about anyone helping. Especially as my knowledge on coding (in C++ and expecially in GL) is limited. 
Only thing to know is that the main focus of the project is on the ease of use and integration for the final user. So: 
- the better it fits in the "openFrameworks way", the better
- the easier to use for beginners, the better.
- the shorter the code to use in the openFrameworks App, the better
